a) Adding a Habit

Function onSaveButtonClick():
    if habitName is not empty:
        habit = {
            name: habitName,
            date: getCurrentDate(),	//store current date
            completed: false		//habit starts as not completed
        }
        save(habit)

Function save(habit):
      habitsList.append(habit)


b) Mark as Done

Function onMarkAsDoneButtonClick(habit):
    for each h in habitsList:
        if h.name == habit.name and h.date == getCurrentDate():	//if we find the habit
            h.completed = true					//we mark it as completed


c)Daily Progress:

Function getDailyProgress():
    today = getCurrentDate()
    totalHabits = 0                 			//counter for all habits from today
    completedToday = 0              			//counter for completed habits today

    for each habit in habitsList:
        if habit.date == today:
            totalHabits += 1
            if habit.completed == true:
                completedToday += 1

    if totalHabits == 0:
        progress = 0                			//avoid division by 0
    else:
        progress = completedToday / totalHabits  	//calculate progress as a ratio

    return {
        completedToday: completedToday,
        totalHabits: totalHabits,
        progress: progress
    }
